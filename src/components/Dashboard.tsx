      "This rule can also be called the “account stop-loss” Maximum loss is a fixed figured representing the difference between your initial account balance and current equity which can not fall below the specified value for the plan. For example, If your initial account balance is 10k and you have a max drawdown of 8%, your maximum loss value will remain at $9,200 for the duration of your challenge. If still aren't sure, watch the following video for an in depth breakdown.",

The counting formula: Current daily loss = balance at the start of the day - current equity.",

      "Depending on chosen trading strategy and phase the minimum profit target to complete the phase or earn commission is set between 5-10% of the initial balance. Profit target means that a trader reaches a profit target specified in the plan of the initial account balance in the sum of closed positions. The trading period is unlimited and the profit target can be met at your leisure without any restrictions. For example: If you trade Challenge with $10,000 capital targeting a minimum of 5%, your profit target is $500. After completing the Verification period (Phase 2), the minimum profit target will be removed. You can trade your Phase 3 account as long as you do not reach the maximum loss limits or violate other rules or objectives.",

A trading day is considered any day when at least one trade is executed. If a trade is held over multiple days, the day when the trade was executed is considered as the trading day. You can proceed to the next phase without waiting.",
